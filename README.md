# Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

This repository contains my assignment for **data analysis and visualization** using Python libraries **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset (Iris dataset).
- Perform basic data analysis (statistics, groupings).
- Create visualizations to identify patterns and insights.

## 📂 Contents
- `Data_Analysis_Assignment_Final.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
1. Line chart showing trends in sepal length across samples.
2. Bar chart comparing average petal length by species.
3. Histogram of sepal width distribution.
4. Scatter plot of sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species.

## ✅ Conclusion
From the analysis, clear differences were found between species:
- *Iris Virginica* has the largest petals.  
- *Iris Setosa* has the smallest petals.  
- Sepal width is normally distributed around 3 cm.  
- There is a strong positive correlation between sepal length and petal length.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
